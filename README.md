### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mahdieh, a senior React-Native Developer who is always up for a new challenge. For the past four years I've been delving into the development of modern apps and new technologies, with a keen focus on Blockchain and GPT-3. My venture into the online world has been full of creativity and now, I'm ready to bring that to fruition as a founder of my own online startup. You can find me online on Twitter, Youtube, and StackOverflow, where I keep a portfolio of my work. 
Get in touch and let's make something amazing! âœ¨
